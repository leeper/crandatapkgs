# CRAN Data-only Packages

**This package is deprecated and will not be updated in the future. It has been archived on CRAN.**

This package provides a simple function that lists data-only packages (or those primarily offering built-in datasets) that are available on CRAN. It does this by subsetting the output of `avaialable.packages()` to return a data.frame of known data-heavy and data-only packages.

To retrieve a data frame listing of these known packages in R, simply do:

```{r}
library("crandatapkgs")
options(repos = c("https://cloud.r-project.org"))
a <- available_data()

# data structure returned by `available_data()`
str(a)

# a few packages from the response
a[1:3,]
```

## Contributing Known Packages ##

New packages can be added by creating a GitHub pull request that edits the [packages](https://github.com/leeper/crandatapkgs/blob/master/inst/packages/packages) comma-separated values file and adding a row for a package in the form of:

```
PackageName,Type,"Data Description"
```

where `Type` is either `Data` (for data-only packages) or `Supplement` (for packages that provide data supplements to other packages or texts). `Data Description` should be a double-quoted description of the kind of data found in the package.
